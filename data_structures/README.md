# Data Structures Algorithms

A data structure is a way to organize and store information. These data structures store data and possibly metadata

## Stack

### Abstract

It is a data structure that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations:

- **Push** - adds an element to the collection
- **Pop** - removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The elements of this data structure are taken and added using a **LIFO** (Last-In First-Out) order. Elements can only be added on the top of the stack and are then removed from the top.

### Complexities

- **Push** - Θ(1)
- **Pop** - Θ(1)

## Queue

### Abstract

It is a data structure with fixed size of length *n*, with two main operations:

- **Enqueue** - adds an element to the collection
- **Dequeue** - removes the first element from the collection that was not yet removed

The elements of these data structure are taken and added wsing a **FIFO** (First-In First-Out) order. Elements can only be added at the beginning of the queue and taken from the end of the queue.
