# Problem:
# Given a number k, a step-k sequence of length l is a sequence of l numbers
# a1, a2 , . . . , al such that either ai = ai+1 + k for all pairs of adjacent
# elements ai , ai+1, r ai + k = ai+1 for all pairs of adjacent elements ai,ai+1.
# For example, the sequence , 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8 is a step-1.5 sequence, and 7, 4, 1,
# âˆ’2 is a step-3 sequence.

#Complexity:
# O(n)
